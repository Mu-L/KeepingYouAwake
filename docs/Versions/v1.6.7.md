# Version 1.6.7: External Display Fixes and Translation Updates

- fixed two issues with the "Activate when an external display is connected" advanced setting:
    - fixed an issue where multiple `caffeinate` tasks were spawned when an external display was connected ([#203](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/issues/203))
    - fixed an issue where a mirrored display was not treated internally as external display ([#210](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/issues/210))
- fixed an issue where the menu bar icon did not update properly when the URL scheme was used to activate or deactivate ([#224](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/issues/224))
- updated the Spanish translations ([#223](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/pull/223))

    - *Thank you [ziz1zaza](https://github.com/ziz1zaza)!*
- since macOS 26 Tahoe allows hiding the app's menu bar icon, the settings window was extended to handle this situation better:
    - the settings window will now be presented when the app is launched again while running
    - added a Quit button to the General settings
- updated the app icon to not be trapped in a grey box on macOS 26 Tahoe
