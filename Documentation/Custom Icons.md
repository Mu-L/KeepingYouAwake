# Custom Icons

KeepingYouAwake 1.2.2beta2 and newer allows the use of custom icons.

## Usage

Just place four images named 

- `ActiveIcon.png` (22x20px)
- `ActiveIcon@2x.png` (44x40px)
- `InactiveIcon.png` (22x20px)
- `InactiveIcon@2x.png` (44x40px)

in your `~/Library/Containers/info.marcel-dierkes.KeepingYouAwake/Data/Documents` folder. These images are treated as template images, so it's recommended to only use black as base color and different opacity values for e.g. shadows or lighter areas.

Please see the example PNG image files in the "Custom Icons" folder.

---

> Older versions (< 1.5.0) without App Sandbox support require the icons to be located in `~/Library/Application Support/KeepingYouAwake/`.
